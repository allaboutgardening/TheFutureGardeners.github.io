    <h3 class="topic">1 . Prepare your soil </h3>
    <p class="content">Remove weeds and large stones and fork over the soil if it is compacted. If the soil has recently been forked or dug over, or if it is newly added soil, lightly tread over the area once. Rake the soil until it has a fine, crumbly texture, with a flat (ideally level) surface.</p>

    <h1 class="topic">2 . Broadcast seed</h1>
    <p class="content">Add sand to your seeds and scatter the mixture evenly across the prepared ground, moving your hand across the area in different directions. A 50/50 mix of sand and seeds is particularly useful when sowing small seeds.</p>

    <h1 class="topic">3 . Make drills</h1>
    <p class="content">Use a hoe, A cane is a slender, straight, length of woody plant material, usually bamboo. Canes are primarily used as plant supports. The fruiting stems of blackberries, raspberries and hybrid berries (such as loganberries and tayberries) are also known as canes, so these crops are often referred to as cane fruit.cane or stick to make a drill. If you want straight rows, use a string line or bamboo cane on the soil to guide you. Check the seed packet for the recommended sowing depth, or follow the general rule of sowing at a depth of about two or three times the size of the seed, to determine how deep the drill needs to be. If sowing more than one row, check the seed packet for the recommended spacing between rows.</p>

    <h1 class="topic">7 . Keep a record</h1>
    <p class="content">Place a plant label at the end of the drill, or in the corner of the area you broadcast, recording the plant and date of sowing. Birds sometimes like to remove plant labels, so keep a record in a notebook too and insert canes/sticks at either end of your drills as markers.</p>

    <h1 class="topic">8 . Water the soil where seeds have been sown</h1>
    <p class="content">Water to settle the soil and seeds. Use a watering can with the rose upside down or a hose with a fine spray to avoid disturbing the soil.</p>
